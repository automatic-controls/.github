## About

Founded in 1978 by Robert Vogt Sr., [Automatic Controls](https://automaticcontrols.net/) is a second-generation family business that started by providing support and installation of pneumatic controls. As building technology changed, we evolved our focus to DDC controls systems. And in 1990, we became the Automated Logic Dealer for Eastern Missouri and are thrilled to be continuing our partnership moving forward. We serve the eastern half of Missouri including the greater St. Louis area, Columbia, Ste. Genevieve, Cape Girardeau, and Jefferson City.

We control and optimize energy consumption in commercial properties, such as schools, universities, hospitals, data centers, and office buildings. Our innovative, user friendly automation system combined with our industry leading customer service has served to sustain our reputation as a leader in the industry.

As an independent dealer, Automatic Controls is backed by Automated Logic‚Äôs industry-leading technology, while providing you with local, on the ground service.

WebCTRL is the software used to interface with building automation systems we provide. Most of the repositories in this organization contain source code for add-ons to extend WebCTRL's functionality. Another software package, EIKON, is used to build logic which is downloaded directly into building controllers. EIKON has a scripting API which is leveraged in a couple of our repositories. Another few of our repositories contain batch files utilized for various purposes.
